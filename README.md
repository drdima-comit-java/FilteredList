# FilteredList
This project is made for computer technicians that work in a big companies. 
They need to take old computers from users and give them a new computer with the same installed applications. 
The problem is that I don't need to install all aplications. 
I have to exclude some of aplications from the original list. 
My program takes a list of software that is installed on old computer and filteres that list. 
It helps me to filter it in fast and easy way.
What is left from that list is exactly what I will install on the new computer. 
And it also makes it easy to run the installer.
